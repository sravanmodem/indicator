# 1. TREND INDICATORS

## 1.1 SUPERTREND

### What It Is
SuperTrend is an ATR-based trend-following indicator that plots a trailing stop line above or below price. It's the single most effective indicator for NIFTY intraday option buying.

### Parameters
| Parameter | Scalping | Intraday | Swing |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| ATR Period | 7 | 10 | 10 |
| Multiplier | 2.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 |
| Timeframe | 3 min | 5-15 min | 1 hour |

### Calculation
```
ATR = Average True Range over N periods

Upper Band = (High + Low) / 2 + (Multiplier × ATR)
Lower Band = (High + Low) / 2 - (Multiplier × ATR)

SuperTrend = Lower Band (in uptrend)
SuperTrend = Upper Band (in downtrend)
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price closes ABOVE SuperTrend line | **BUY CE** |
| Price closes BELOW SuperTrend line | **BUY PE** |
| SuperTrend flips from red to green | Fresh CE entry |
| SuperTrend flips from green to red | Fresh PE entry |

### Entry Rules
```
CE ENTRY:
- Wait for candle to CLOSE above SuperTrend (not just touch)
- Enter on next candle open
- Stop loss: SuperTrend line value
- Target: 1:2 risk-reward minimum

PE ENTRY:
- Wait for candle to CLOSE below SuperTrend
- Enter on next candle open
- Stop loss: SuperTrend line value
- Target: 1:2 risk-reward minimum
```

### Avoid When
- ADX < 20 (ranging market, SuperTrend will whipsaw)
- First 15 minutes of market open
- Last 30 minutes before close
- Around major news events

### Pro Tips
- Use ATR multiplier 2.0 for aggressive entries, 3.0 for conservative
- In strong trends, trail your stop using SuperTrend value
- Combine with VWAP for confirmation

## 1.2 EMA CROSSOVER SYSTEM

### What It Is
Exponential Moving Averages give more weight to recent prices. Crossovers signal momentum shifts before price confirms.

### Recommended EMA Combinations
| Style | Fast EMA | Slow EMA | Signal EMA |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Scalping | 5 | 13 | 8 |
| Intraday | 9 | 21 | 13 |
| Swing | 21 | 50 | 34 |
| Positional | 50 | 200 | 100 |

### Calculation
```
EMA = Price(t) × k + EMA(y) × (1 − k)

Where:
k = 2 ÷ (N + 1)
N = number of periods
t = today
y = yesterday
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### PRIMARY SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Fast EMA crosses ABOVE Slow EMA | **BUY CE** | Strong |
| Fast EMA crosses BELOW Slow EMA | **BUY PE** | Strong |
| Price above both EMAs + EMAs rising | CE bias | Confirmation |
| Price below both EMAs + EMAs falling | PE bias | Confirmation |

#### ADVANCED: TRIPLE EMA SYSTEM
```
CE SIGNAL (All must be true):
✓ 9 EMA > 21 EMA > 50 EMA
✓ Price pulls back to 9 EMA and bounces
✓ All EMAs sloping upward

PE SIGNAL (All must be true):
✓ 9 EMA < 21 EMA < 50 EMA
✓ Price pulls back to 9 EMA and rejects
✓ All EMAs sloping downward
```

### Entry Technique
```
AGGRESSIVE ENTRY:
- Enter immediately on crossover candle close

CONSERVATIVE ENTRY:
- Wait for pullback to fast EMA after crossover
- Enter on bounce/rejection from EMA
- This gives better risk-reward
```

### Stop Loss Placement
| Entry Type | Stop Loss Location |
|------------|-------------------|
| Crossover entry | Below slow EMA (CE) / Above slow EMA (PE) |
| Pullback entry | Below swing low (CE) / Above swing high (PE) |
| Fixed points | 20-30 NIFTY points |

## 1.3 VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

### What It Is
VWAP represents the average price weighted by volume - the "fair value" for the day. Institutional traders use VWAP as benchmark for execution.

### Calculation
```
VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) ÷ Σ(Volume)

Calculated cumulatively from market open
Resets each trading day
```

### VWAP Bands (Standard Deviation)
```
Upper Band 1 = VWAP + 1 × StdDev
Upper Band 2 = VWAP + 2 × StdDev
Lower Band 1 = VWAP - 1 × StdDev
Lower Band 2 = VWAP - 2 × StdDev
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

| Condition | Action | Context |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Price crosses ABOVE VWAP | **BUY CE** | Trend day starting |
| Price crosses BELOW VWAP | **BUY PE** | Trend day starting |
| Price at VWAP + 2σ band | Avoid CE / Consider PE | Overextended |
| Price at VWAP - 2σ band | Avoid PE / Consider CE | Overextended |
| Price hovering at VWAP | NO TRADE | Indecision |

### VWAP Trading Rules
```
TRENDING DAY (ADX > 25):
- Price above VWAP: Only buy CE, buy dips to VWAP
- Price below VWAP: Only buy PE, sell rallies to VWAP

RANGING DAY (ADX < 20):
- Fade moves at ±2σ bands
- Buy CE at lower band, Buy PE at upper band

FIRST CROSS STRATEGY:
- First VWAP cross of the day often signals daily direction
- If first cross is bullish → CE bias for the day
- If first cross is bearish → PE bias for the day
```

### Pro Tips
- Anchored VWAP from swing high/low gives key S/R levels
- VWAP slope indicates intraday trend strength
- High volume candles near VWAP = strong institutional interest

## 1.4 ADX (Average Directional Index) + DI System

### What It Is
ADX measures trend STRENGTH (not direction). +DI and -DI measure directional movement.

### Parameters
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Period | 14 (standard) |
| Trend threshold | 25 |
| Strong trend | 40+ |

### Calculation
```
+DM = Current High - Previous High (if positive)
-DM = Previous Low - Current Low (if positive)

+DI = 100 × Smoothed(+DM) ÷ ATR
-DI = 100 × Smoothed(-DM) ÷ ATR

DX = 100 × |+DI - -DI| ÷ (+DI + -DI)
ADX = Smoothed DX over N periods
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

| ADX Value | +DI vs -DI | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| ADX > 25 | +DI > -DI | **BUY CE** (trending up) |
| ADX > 25 | -DI > +DI | **BUY PE** (trending down) |
| ADX < 20 | Any | NO TREND TRADE |
| ADX rising | +DI crossing above -DI | Fresh CE signal |
| ADX rising | -DI crossing above +DI | Fresh PE signal |

### ADX Interpretation Matrix
```
ADX < 20:     Weak/No trend → Avoid directional options
ADX 20-25:    Trend developing → Prepare for entry
ADX 25-40:    Strong trend → Ideal for option buying
ADX 40-50:    Very strong trend → Trail positions
ADX > 50:     Extreme trend → Watch for exhaustion
ADX falling:  Trend weakening → Book profits
```

### Entry Strategy
```
BEST CE ENTRY:
- ADX crosses above 25 from below
- +DI already above -DI
- Price confirms with higher high

BEST PE ENTRY:
- ADX crosses above 25 from below
- -DI already above +DI
- Price confirms with lower low

AVOID:
- ADX declining from high levels (trend exhaustion)
- DI lines too close together (no clear direction)
```

# 2. MOMENTUM INDICATORS

## 2.1 RSI (Relative Strength Index)

### What It Is
RSI measures the speed and magnitude of price changes on a 0-100 scale. It identifies momentum shifts and overbought/oversold conditions.

### Parameters
| Setting | Scalping | Intraday | Swing |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Period | 7 | 14 | 14 |
| Overbought | 70 | 70 | 70 |
| Oversold | 30 | 30 | 30 |
| Neutral | 50 | 50 | 50 |

### Calculation
```
RS = Average Gain over N periods ÷ Average Loss over N periods
RSI = 100 - (100 ÷ (1 + RS))
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### MOMENTUM SIGNALS (Trending Markets)
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| RSI crosses ABOVE 50 | **BUY CE** | Medium |
| RSI crosses BELOW 50 | **BUY PE** | Medium |
| RSI crosses ABOVE 60 | **BUY CE** | Strong |
| RSI crosses BELOW 40 | **BUY PE** | Strong |

#### REVERSAL SIGNALS (Ranging Markets)
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| RSI < 30, then crosses above 30 | **BUY CE** | Strong reversal |
| RSI > 70, then crosses below 70 | **BUY PE** | Strong reversal |

#### DIVERGENCE SIGNALS (High Accuracy)
```
BULLISH DIVERGENCE → BUY CE:
- Price makes LOWER LOW
- RSI makes HIGHER LOW
- Entry: When RSI crosses above prior swing high

BEARISH DIVERGENCE → BUY PE:
- Price makes HIGHER HIGH
- RSI makes LOWER HIGH
- Entry: When RSI crosses below prior swing low
```

### RSI Range Shift Strategy
```
BULLISH MARKET:
- RSI oscillates between 40-80
- Buy CE when RSI touches 40-50 zone
- Avoid PE when RSI stays above 40

BEARISH MARKET:
- RSI oscillates between 20-60
- Buy PE when RSI touches 50-60 zone
- Avoid CE when RSI stays below 60
```

### Pro Tips
- RSI 50 level is the most important for momentum
- Look for RSI holding above 40 in uptrends (40-80 range)
- Look for RSI holding below 60 in downtrends (20-60 range)
- Hidden divergence = trend continuation signal

## 2.2 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

### What It Is
MACD shows the relationship between two EMAs. It identifies trend direction, momentum, and potential reversals.

### Parameters
| Setting | Standard | Fast | Slow |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| Fast EMA | 12 | 8 | 19 |
| Slow EMA | 26 | 17 | 39 |
| Signal | 9 | 9 | 9 |

### Calculation
```
MACD Line = 12 EMA - 26 EMA
Signal Line = 9 EMA of MACD Line
Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### CROSSOVER SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| MACD crosses ABOVE Signal line | **BUY CE** | Medium |
| MACD crosses BELOW Signal line | **BUY PE** | Medium |
| Crossover above zero line | CE more reliable | Strong |
| Crossover below zero line | PE more reliable | Strong |

#### ZERO LINE SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|

- MACD: Higher Low
- Confirmation: MACD crosses above signal line

BEARISH DIVERGENCE → BUY PE:
- Price: Higher High
- MACD: Lower High
- Confirmation: MACD crosses below signal line
```

### MACD Histogram Strategy
```
MOMENTUM BUILDING:
- Histogram bars increasing = momentum strengthening
- Stay in position

MOMENTUM FADING:

## 2.3 STOCHASTIC OSCILLATOR

### What It Is
Stochastic compares closing price to the high-low range over a period. It's excellent for identifying reversal points.

### Parameters
| Setting | Fast | Slow | Full |
|---------|------|------|------|
| %K Period | 5 | 14 | 14 |
| %D Period | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| Smooth | 1 | 3 | 3 |

### Calculation
```
%K = 100 × (Close - Lowest Low) ÷ (Highest High - Lowest Low)
%D = 3-period SMA of %K
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### CROSSOVER SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Zone |
|-----------|--------|------|
| %K crosses ABOVE %D in oversold (<20) | **BUY CE** | High probability |
| %K crosses BELOW %D in overbought (>80) | **BUY PE** | High probability |
| %K crosses ABOVE %D in neutral zone | CE bias | Lower probability |
| %K crosses BELOW %D in neutral zone | PE bias | Lower probability |

#### ZONE SIGNALS
```
OVERSOLD ZONE (< 20):
- Wait for %K to cross above %D
- Wait for both lines to exit oversold zone
- BUY CE on confirmation

OVERBOUGHT ZONE (> 80):
- Wait for %K to cross below %D
- Wait for both lines to exit overbought zone
- BUY PE on confirmation
```

#### DIVERGENCE SIGNALS
```
BULLISH DIVERGENCE → BUY CE:
- Price: Lower Low
- Stochastic: Higher Low in oversold zone
- Very high probability reversal signal

BEARISH DIVERGENCE → BUY PE:
- Price: Higher High
- Stochastic: Lower High in overbought zone
- Very high probability reversal signal
```

### Pro Tips

## 2.4 CCI (Commodity Channel Index)

### What It Is
CCI measures price deviation from statistical mean. It identifies cyclical trends and extreme price movements.

### Parameters
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Period | 20 (standard) |
| Overbought | +100 |
| Oversold | -100 |
| Extreme OB | +200 |
| Extreme OS | -200 |

### Calculation
```
Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) ÷ 3
SMA = 20-period SMA of Typical Price
Mean Deviation = Average of absolute deviations from SMA
CCI = (Typical Price - SMA) ÷ (0.015 × Mean Deviation)
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### BREAKOUT SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| CCI crosses ABOVE +100 | **BUY CE** | Breakout |
| CCI crosses BELOW -100 | **BUY PE** | Breakdown |
| CCI > +200 | Extreme strength, trail CE | Overbought |
| CCI < -200 | Extreme weakness, trail PE | Oversold |

#### ZERO LINE SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| CCI crosses above zero | CE bias | Trend confirmation |
| CCI crosses below zero | PE bias | Trend confirmation |

#### REVERSAL SIGNALS
```
CE REVERSAL ENTRY:
- CCI drops below -100
- CCI crosses back above -100
- Indicates selling exhaustion → BUY CE

PE REVERSAL ENTRY:
- CCI rises above +100
- CCI crosses back below +100
- Indicates buying exhaustion → BUY PE
```

### CCI Divergence
```
BULLISH DIVERGENCE → BUY CE:
- Price: Lower Low
- CCI: Higher Low (especially if below -100)

BEARISH DIVERGENCE → BUY PE:
- Price: Higher High
- CCI: Lower High (especially if above +100)
```

# 3. VOLUME-BASED INDICATORS

## 3.1 OBV (On Balance Volume)

### What It Is
OBV adds volume on up days and subtracts on down days. It shows whether volume is flowing into or out of a security.

### Calculation
```
If Close > Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV + Volume
If Close < Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV - Volume
If Close = Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### TREND SIGNALS
| Condition | Action | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| OBV rising + Price rising | **BUY CE** | Confirmed uptrend |
| OBV falling + Price falling | **BUY PE** | Confirmed downtrend |
| OBV making new highs | CE strength | Accumulation |
| OBV making new lows | PE strength | Distribution |

#### DIVERGENCE SIGNALS (MOST POWERFUL)
```
BULLISH DIVERGENCE → BUY CE:
- Price: Making lower lows or flat
- OBV: Making higher lows or rising
- Meaning: Smart money accumulating
- Action: Buy CE on price confirmation

BEARISH DIVERGENCE → BUY PE:
- Price: Making higher highs or flat
- OBV: Making lower highs or falling
- Meaning: Smart money distributing
- Action: Buy PE on price confirmation
```

#### OBV BREAKOUT STRATEGY
```
OBV BREAKOUT:
- Draw trendlines on OBV
- OBV breaks above trendline before price → Early CE signal
- OBV breaks below trendline before price → Early PE signal
- OBV often leads price by 1-3 candles
```

---

## 3.2 VOLUME PROFILE (ADVANCED)

### What It Is
Volume Profile shows volume traded at each price level, identifying high-volume nodes (support/resistance) and low-volume areas (price moves quickly through).

### Key Levels
```
POC (Point of Control): Price with highest volume → Strong S/R
VAH (Value Area High): Upper boundary of 70% volume → Resistance
VAL (Value Area Low): Lower boundary of 70% volume → Support
HVN (High Volume Node): High activity zone → Price tends to stay
LVN (Low Volume Node): Low activity zone → Price moves fast through
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

| Condition | Action | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Price breaks above VAH with volume | **BUY CE** | Breakout confirmed |
| Price breaks below VAL with volume | **BUY PE** | Breakdown confirmed |
| Price at POC, momentum up | CE bias | Strong support holding |
| Price at POC, momentum down | PE bias | Failed to hold support |
| Price in LVN zone | Quick move expected | Direction per other indicators |

### Volume Profile Strategy
```
BREAKOUT TRADE:
- Price consolidating at POC
- Break above VAH → BUY CE, target next HVN
- Break below VAL → BUY PE, target next HVN

FADE TRADE:
- Price at extreme (above VAH or below VAL)
- Rejection candle forms
- Fade back to POC
```

---

## 3.3 VOLUME SPREAD ANALYSIS (VSA)

### What It Is
VSA analyzes the relationship between price range, closing position, and volume to identify smart money activity.

### Key Patterns

#### BULLISH VSA → BUY CE
```
NO SUPPLY (Bullish):
- Down bar (close < open)
- Narrow spread
- High volume
- Close near high of bar
- Meaning: Selling absorbed by buyers

STOPPING VOLUME (Bullish):
- Down bar
- Very high volume
- Close well off lows
- Meaning: Demand stopping the selling

SPRING/SHAKEOUT (Bullish):
- Price breaks below support
- High volume
- Quick recovery above support
- Meaning: Weak hands cleared, markup begins
```

#### BEARISH VSA → BUY PE
```
NO DEMAND (Bearish):
- Up bar (close > open)
- Narrow spread
- Low volume
- Meaning: No buying interest, weakness

UPTHRUST (Bearish):
- Price makes new high
- High volume
- Close near low of bar
- Meaning: Supply overwhelming demand

END OF RISING MARKET:
- Very high volume
- Wide spread up bar
- But next bar fails to follow through
- Meaning: Distribution complete, decline begins
```

# 4. OPTIONS-SPECIFIC INDICATORS

## 4.1 OPEN INTEREST ANALYSIS

### What It Is
Open Interest shows the total number of outstanding contracts. Changes in OI indicate whether money is flowing in or out.

### OI Change Interpretation
| Price | OI | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|-----|----------------|--------|
| ↑ Up | ↑ Up | Long buildup | **BUY CE** |
| ↑ Up | ↓ Down | Short covering | Book CE profits |
| ↓ Down | ↑ Up | Short buildup | **BUY PE** |
| ↓ Down | ↓ Down | Long unwinding | Book PE profits |

### Strike-Wise OI Analysis
```
SUPPORT IDENTIFICATION:
- Find strike with highest PUT OI
- This is PUT WALL = Strong support
- Price unlikely to break below this level
- Break of put wall with volume → Strong PE signal

RESISTANCE IDENTIFICATION:
- Find strike with highest CALL OI
- This is CALL WALL = Strong resistance
- Price unlikely to break above this level
- Break of call wall with volume → Strong CE signal
```

### OI Change Strategy
```
INTRADAY OI MONITORING:
- Check OI every 30 minutes
- Significant call OI addition at strike → Resistance
- Significant put OI addition at strike → Support
- OI unwinding = Directional move incoming

ENTRY RULES:
CE ENTRY:
- Put OI unwinding at support + Price bouncing
- Call OI adding at higher strikes (bullish bets)
- Short covering (price up + call OI down at ATM)

PE ENTRY:
- Call OI unwinding at resistance + Price rejecting
- Put OI adding at lower strikes (bearish bets)
- Long unwinding (price down + put OI down at ATM)
```

---

## 4.2 PUT-CALL RATIO (PCR)

### What It Is
PCR measures the ratio of put options to call options. It's a sentiment indicator showing crowd positioning.

### Calculation
```
PCR (OI) = Total Put OI ÷ Total Call OI
PCR (Volume) = Put Volume ÷ Call Volume
```

### Interpretation
| PCR Value | Sentiment | Contrarian Signal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| > 1.5 | Extreme fear | **BUY CE** (bottom near) |
| 1.2 - 1.5 | Bearish | CE bias |
| 0.8 - 1.2 | Neutral | No bias |
| 0.5 - 0.8 | Bullish | PE bias |
| < 0.5 | Extreme greed | **BUY PE** (top near) |

### PCR Strategy
```
CONTRARIAN STRATEGY:
- PCR > 1.3 and rising → Market oversold → BUY CE
- PCR < 0.7 and falling → Market overbought → BUY PE
- Works best at extremes

TREND CONFIRMATION:
- PCR rising from 0.8 to 1.0 → Put buying increasing → Bearish
- PCR falling from 1.2 to 1.0 → Call buying increasing → Bullish

INTRADAY PCR SHIFT:
- Monitor PCR every hour
- Rapid PCR increase → Fear spike → CE opportunity
- Rapid PCR decrease → Greed spike → PE opportunity
```

### Pro Tips
- Use NIFTY weekly expiry PCR for short-term signals
- Use NIFTY monthly expiry PCR for swing signals
- Combine with technical levels for high-probability trades

---

## 4.3 MAX PAIN

### What It Is
Max Pain is the strike price where option buyers (both calls and puts) would lose the maximum money. Markets tend to gravitate toward max pain at expiry.

### Calculation
```
For each strike:
- Calculate total put buyer loss if price expires there
- Calculate total call buyer loss if price expires there
- Sum both losses
- Max Pain = Strike with highest combined loss
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

| Spot vs Max Pain | Days to Expiry | Action |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Spot << Max Pain | > 3 days | **BUY CE** (magnet effect) |
| Spot >> Max Pain | > 3 days | **BUY PE** (magnet effect) |
| Spot = Max Pain | Any | Range-bound, avoid buying |
| Spot << Max Pain | < 2 days | CE for magnet effect |
| Spot >> Max Pain | < 2 days | PE for magnet effect |

### Max Pain Strategy
```
WEEKLY EXPIRY (Thursday):
Monday-Tuesday:
- Spot far from max pain → Directional trade toward max pain
- CE if spot below max pain
- PE if spot above max pain

Wednesday:
- If spot near max pain → Avoid directional, sell premium
- If spot still far → Continue directional trade

Thursday:
- Strong magnet effect → Price pins near max pain
- Avoid option buying, theta burn high
```

### Important Notes
- Max pain shifts daily as OI changes
- More reliable for weekly expiry than monthly
- Works best when combined with OI analysis
- Not reliable in strong trending markets (gamma squeeze can override)

---

## 4.4 INDIA VIX

### What It Is
India VIX measures expected 30-day volatility derived from NIFTY option prices. Higher VIX = higher expected volatility = higher option premiums.

### VIX Interpretation
| VIX Level | Market State | Option Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| < 12 | Very low vol, complacent | Options cheap, buy breakouts |
| 12 - 15 | Low vol, calm | Premium fair |
| 15 - 20 | Normal vol | Standard strategies |
| 20 - 25 | Elevated vol | Premium expensive, careful buying |
| > 25 | High vol, fear | Premium very expensive |
| > 35 | Extreme fear | Contrarian CE opportunities |

### VIX-Based CE/PE Signals
```
VIX SPIKE STRATEGY:
- VIX spikes > 20% in a day → Fear extreme
- Look for reversal signals in NIFTY
- BUY CE if NIFTY shows reversal (contrarian)

VIX CRUSH STRATEGY:
- VIX falling from high levels
- Avoid option buying (IV crush will hurt)
- Existing positions lose value even if direction correct

VIX BREAKOUT:
- VIX breaks above recent range
- Expect big move in NIFTY
- Direction: Usually down (VIX up = market down)
- BUY PE on VIX breakout
```

### VIX Term Structure
```
CONTANGO (Normal):
- Near-term VIX < Long-term VIX
- Market calm, normal conditions
- Standard trading

BACKWARDATION (Warning):
- Near-term VIX > Long-term VIX
- Market expects imminent volatility
- Hedge positions, careful buying
- Often precedes market decline
```

---

## 4.5 GAMMA EXPOSURE (GEX) - INSTITUTIONAL INDICATOR

### What It Is
GEX measures the total gamma exposure of market makers. It predicts volatility and likely support/resistance levels.

### Calculation
```
For each strike:
GEX at Strike = (Call Gamma × Call OI × 100) - (Put Gamma × Put OI × 100)
Total GEX = Sum of GEX at all strikes
```

### GEX Interpretation
| GEX | Market Maker Position | Expected Market Behavior |
|-----|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Positive (high) | Long gamma | Low volatility, mean reversion |
| Positive (low) | Slightly long gamma | Normal volatility |
| Negative | Short gamma | High volatility, trending |
| Very negative | Very short gamma | Explosive moves possible |

### GEX Strategy
```
POSITIVE GEX ENVIRONMENT:
- Market makers hedge against them
- Rallies get sold, dips get bought
- Range-bound, mean reversion
- Option buying: Buy extremes, expect snapback

NEGATIVE GEX ENVIRONMENT:
- Market makers hedge with them
- Rallies get bought more, dips get sold more
- Trending, momentum
- Option buying: Buy breakouts, trend following
- Moves can be violent and extended

FLIP POINT:
- Level where GEX flips from positive to negative
- Above flip point: Positive GEX behavior
- Below flip point: Negative GEX behavior
- Key level for intraday direction
```

### GEX Trading Rules
```
IF GEX > 0 (Positive):
- Fade rallies to resistance → Buy PE
- Fade dips to support → Buy CE
- Expect range-bound action
- Option buying less effective (low vol)

IF GEX < 0 (Negative):
- Buy breakouts
- CE on break above resistance
- PE on break below support
- Trends extend further than expected
```

# 5. VOLATILITY INDICATORS

## 5.1 BOLLINGER BANDS

### What It Is
Bollinger Bands plot standard deviations around a moving average. They identify volatility and potential reversal zones.

### Parameters
| Setting | Standard | Tight | Wide |
|---------|----------|-------|------|
| Period | 20 | 10 | 20 |
| Std Dev | 2 | 1.5 | 2.5 |

### Calculation
```
Middle Band = 20-period SMA
Upper Band = Middle Band + (2 × Standard Deviation)
Lower Band = Middle Band - (2 × Standard Deviation)
Bandwidth = (Upper - Lower) / Middle × 100
%B = (Price - Lower) / (Upper - Lower)
```

### CE/PE Signal Logic

#### MEAN REVERSION SIGNALS (Range Markets)
| Condition | Action | Probability |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Price touches lower band + reversal candle | **BUY CE** | High |
| Price touches upper band + reversal candle | **BUY PE** | High |

## 5.2 ATR (Average True Range)

### What It Is
ATR measures volatility by looking at the range of price movement. Higher ATR = higher volatility = larger stop losses needed.

### Parameters
| Setting | Scalping | Intraday | Swing |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Period | 7 | 14 | 14 |

### Calculation
```
True Range = Maximum of:
1. Current High - Current Low
2. |Current High - Previous Close|
3. |Current Low - Previous Close|

ATR = Moving Average of True Range
```

### ATR Applications

#### STOP LOSS CALCULATION
```
CE STOP LOSS:
Entry Price - (1.5 × ATR to 2 × ATR)

PE STOP LOSS:
Entry Price + (1.5 × ATR to 2 × ATR)

EXAMPLE:
NIFTY at 24,000
ATR (14) = 150 points
CE Stop = 24,000 - (2 × 150) = 23,700
PE Stop = 24,000 + (2 × 150) = 24,300
```

#### POSITION SIZING
```
Risk per trade = Account Size × 1%
Position Size = Risk per trade ÷ (ATR × 2)
```

#### VOLATILITY BREAKOUT
```
ATR BREAKOUT STRATEGY:
- Current bar range > 1.5 × ATR
- Indicates volatility expansion
- Trade in direction of breakout bar
- High range up bar → CE
- High range down bar → PE
```

#### ATR TREND FILTER
```
ATR RISING:
- Volatility increasing
- Trend accelerating
- Good for option buying
- Larger targets possible

ATR FALLING:
- Volatility decreasing
- Trend slowing
- Avoid option buying
- Theta will dominate
```

---

## 5.3 IV RANK / IV PERCENTILE

### What It Is
IV Rank shows where current implied volatility stands relative to its 52-week range. It tells you if options are cheap or expensive.

### Calculation
```
IV Rank = (Current IV - 52-week Low IV) ÷ (52-week High IV - 52-week Low IV) × 100

IV Percentile = % of days in past year that IV was below current IV
```

### Interpretation
| IV Rank | Options | Strategy |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 0 - 20% | Cheap | Good for buying CE/PE |
| 20 - 40% | Below average | Buying favorable |
| 40 - 60% | Normal | Neutral |
| 60 - 80% | Expensive | Avoid buying, IV crush risk |
| 80 - 100% | Very expensive | Don't buy, sell premium |

### IV Strategy for Option Buying
```
IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR BUYING:
- IV Rank < 30%
- Direction clear (trend + momentum)
- Expect volatility expansion

AVOID BUYING WHEN:
- IV Rank > 70%
- After major news events (IV inflated)
- Before weekends/holidays (IV crush)

IV CRUSH TRAP:
- Buying options when IV Rank > 70%
- Even if direction correct, IV crush kills profits
- Example: Buy CE before results, stock rises but IV drops 40% → Loss
```

# 6. MARKET STRUCTURE INDICATORS

## 6.1 PIVOT POINTS

### What It Is
Pivot Points are calculated support/resistance levels based on previous day's high, low, close. Widely used by institutional traders.

### Calculation
```
Pivot (P) = (High + Low + Close) ÷ 3

Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 × P) - Low
Support 1 (S1) = (2 × P) - High

Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (High - Low)
Support 2 (S2) = P - (High - Low)

Resistance 3 (R3) = High + 2 × (P - Low)
Support 3 (S3) = Low - 2 × (P - High)
```

### Pivot Point Types
| Type | Use Case | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Standard | General trading | All styles |
| Fibonacci | Trending markets | Swing trading |
| Camarilla | Intraday reversals | Scalping |
| Woodie | Mean reversion | Range trading |

### CE/PE Signal Logic
```
ABOVE PIVOT:
- Daily bias = Bullish
- Trade CE on dips to pivot/S1
- Pivot acts as support

BELOW PIVOT:
- Daily bias = Bearish
- Trade PE on rallies to pivot/R1
- Pivot acts as resistance

BREAKOUT STRATEGY:
- Price breaks above R1 with volume → BUY CE, target R2
- Price breaks below S1 with volume → BUY PE, target S2

REVERSAL STRATEGY:
- Price reaches R2/R3 + reversal candle → BUY PE
- Price reaches S2/S3 + reversal candle → BUY CE
```

### Camarilla Pivots (For Scalping)
```
Camarilla Levels:
H4/L4 = Breakout levels
H3/L3 = Reversal levels

STRATEGY:
- Price opens between H3 and L3 → Range day
- Buy CE at L3 with stop below L4
- Buy PE at H3 with stop above H4
- If price breaks H4 → Strong CE
- If price breaks L4 → Strong PE
```

---

## 6.2 CPR (Central Pivot Range)

### What It Is
CPR is a floor trader's tool that shows a range around the pivot. Width of CPR indicates expected volatility.

### Calculation
```
Pivot = (High + Low + Close) ÷ 3
BC (Bottom CPR) = (High + Low) ÷ 2
TC (Top CPR) = (Pivot - BC) + Pivot

CPR Width = TC - BC
```

### CPR Width Interpretation
| CPR Width | Expected Day | Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Narrow (< 20 points) | Trending day | Trade breakouts |
| Wide (> 50 points) | Ranging day | Trade reversals |
| Very narrow (< 10 points) | Big move expected | Wait for direction, trade aggressively |

### CE/PE Signal Logic
```
PRICE ABOVE CPR:
- Bullish bias
- TC acts as support
- Buy CE on dips to TC
- Target: Day's R1, R2

PRICE BELOW CPR:
- Bearish bias
- BC acts as resistance
- Buy PE on rallies to BC
- Target: Day's S1, S2

VIRGIN CPR:
- CPR that wasn't touched previous day
- Acts as strong magnet
- Price tends to test virgin CPR
```

### Opening vs CPR
```
GAP UP ABOVE CPR:
- Strong bullish
- Buy CE on pullback
- Avoid PE

GAP DOWN BELOW CPR:
- Strong bearish
- Buy PE on pullback
- Avoid CE

OPENS INSIDE CPR:
- Wait for breakout
- Direction unclear
- Trade only after CPR break
```

# 9. RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

## 9.1 POSITION SIZING

### Fixed Risk Method
```
Risk per trade = 1-2% of capital

CALCULATION:
Capital = ₹5,00,000
Risk = 1% = ₹5,000
Option premium = ₹100
Stop loss = ₹30 (30% of premium)
Lot size = 25

Risk per lot = 25 × 30 = ₹750
Maximum lots = ₹5,000 ÷ ₹750 = 6.66 → 6 lots
```

### ATR-Based Position Sizing
```
Risk per trade = ₹5,000
ATR = 150 points
ATR Stop = 1.5 × ATR = 225 points
Delta = 0.4 (assuming ATM option)

Option Move = 225 × 0.4 = 90 points
Position Size = ₹5,000 ÷ (90 × 25) = 2.2 → 2 lots
```

## 9.2 STOP LOSS RULES

### Types of Stop Loss
| Type | Method | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Percentage | 30-40% of premium | Scalping |
| Technical | Below support/resistance | Intraday |
| ATR-based | 1.5-2 × ATR | Swing |
| Time-based | Exit if no move in X candles | All |
| Trailing | Move stop as trade profits | Trending |

### Stop Loss Guidelines
```
INTRADAY:
- Maximum loss: 30-40% of premium
- Time stop: Exit if no move in 3-5 candles
- Trail stop: Move to cost after 1:1 profit

SWING:
- Maximum loss: 50% of premium
- Technical stop: Below swing low (CE) / Above swing high (PE)
- Trail stop: Move below each higher low (CE) / above each lower high (PE)
```

## 9.3 PROFIT TAKING RULES

### Fixed Target Method
```
SCALPING: 1:1 to 1:1.5 risk-reward
INTRADAY: 1:2 risk-reward
SWING: 1:3 risk-reward
```

### Partial Profit Method
```
1st Target (50% position): 1:1 RR - Move stop to cost
2nd Target (30% position): 1:2 RR - Trail stop
Final Target (20% position): Let it run with trailing stop
```

### Time-Based Exit
```
WEEKLY EXPIRY TRADES:
- Monday-Wednesday: Hold if profitable
- Thursday: Exit by 2 PM regardless
- Never hold overnight on expiry day

MONTHLY EXPIRY:
- Exit 3-5 days before expiry (theta acceleration)

- 15 min for intraday
- Daily for swing
- Look for entry signals aligned with higher TF trend

STEP 3: ENTRY on Lower TF
- 3-5 min for intraday
- 1 hour for swing
- Fine-tune entry for best risk-reward
```

### Example
```
SWING TRADE SETUP:

WEEKLY (Trend):
- NIFTY in uptrend (higher highs, higher lows)
- Above 50 EMA
- Conclusion: Only look for CE

DAILY (Setup):
- Pullback to 21 EMA
- RSI at 45 (not oversold)
- Bullish engulfing at EMA
- Conclusion: CE setup formed

HOURLY (Entry):
- Wait for break above daily candle high
- Enter with stop below daily candle low
- Conclusion: Execute CE entry

TARGET:
- Daily chart: Previous swing high
- Weekly chart: Potential to upper channel
```
